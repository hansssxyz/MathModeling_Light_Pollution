# MathModeling_Light_Pollution

Hi! This github repo is part of our math modeling project which aims at measuring the amount of light pollution in various regions of the world(urban,surburban, and rurals
areas, etc). Our physics model were based on rayleigh and mie scattering formulas, and our optimization step came from the scipy library, more specifically, a gradient descent
algothm called BFGS. 

Brief Explaination of each file :

2313910.pdf is our final report

mcm_impact_data.xlsx and mcm_city_data.xlsx are raw datas that we've gathered using selenium autowebdrivers from the internet

light scattering.ipynb is the actual file of the model

training.csv is the file documenting all the training process
